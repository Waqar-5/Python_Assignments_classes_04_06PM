Loop Learning Simulator

A fun Python project that demonstrates the power of while loops through real-world simulations.
Each feature is like a small app that teaches you how loops work in different scenarios 🚀.

✨ Features

🔐 Password Checker

Keeps asking for a password until the correct one is entered.

Access is denied after 3 wrong attempts.

🏧 ATM Simulator

Enter your PIN (loops until correct).

Perform actions like Withdraw, Check Balance, or Exit.

📊 Progress Bar Simulator

Simulates a loading bar from 0% to 100% using while loop.

🤖 Simple Chatbot

Keeps chatting until you type "bye".

🚦 Traffic Light Simulator

Cycles through Red → Green → Yellow like real traffic lights.

🚕 Taxi Meter Simulator

Simulates fare increasing with distance in real time.

🔄 While vs Do-While Simulation

Shows the difference between while and do-while loop logic in Python.

♾️ Infinite Loop Demo

Demonstrates an infinite loop and how to break it safely.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 3.x

time (for delays)

random (for chatbot responses)

🎯 Learning Outcomes

By using this project, you will:
✔ Understand how while loops work in Python.
✔ Learn how to use break and continue effectively.
✔ Simulate real-world applications with loops.
✔ Practice problem-solving by modifying and expanding each function.

🚀 Future Improvements

Add colors/animations for progress bars and traffic lights.
