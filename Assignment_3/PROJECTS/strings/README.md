# 📘 Interview-Style String Challenges

## Overview
This project is a **dynamic practice hub** for mastering **string manipulation problems** that are commonly asked in **Python coding interviews**.  
It includes hands-on coding challenges, interactive menu navigation, and **interview-style insights** to strengthen both your **problem-solving skills** and **theory concepts**.

---

## ✨ Features
- 🚀 **Interactive menu-based project**: Choose problems by number or run all challenges at once.
- 🧩 **10 real-world + interview-style string problems**.
- 💡 **2 interview theory questions** with clear, concise explanations.
- ✅ Easy-to-understand code, structured for beginners and interview prep.

## 📂 Sections
### **Section F: String Challenges**
| #  | Challenge | Description |
|----|-----------|-------------|
| 59 | Remove duplicate characters | Removes duplicates while keeping order. |
| 60 | First non-repeated character | Finds the first unique character in a string. |
| 61 | Rotate string left | Rotates string characters (e.g., `abc` → `bca`). |
| 62 | Compress string | Encodes repeating characters (`aaabb` → `a3b2`). |
| 63 | Reverse words in sentence | Reverses word order without slicing. |
| 64 | Count uppercase vs lowercase | Counts uppercase and lowercase letters separately. |
| 65 | Validate password | Checks if password has **≥8 chars & at least 1 digit**. |
| 66 | Find duplicate words | Identifies repeating words in a paragraph. |
| 67 | Count vowel frequency | Counts frequency of vowels (`a, e, i, o, u`). |
| 68 | Check anagrams | Compares two strings to see if they are anagrams. |

### **Interview Questions**
| #   | Question | Answer |
|-----|----------|--------|
| 69  | Difference between **Immutable vs Mutable** | Immutable: `str`, `tuple` (cannot change after creation). Mutable: `list`, `dict` (modifiable). |
| 70  | Why are strings immutable in Python? | Ensures **memory efficiency**, **hashability**, **thread-safety**, and prevents accidental changes. |
