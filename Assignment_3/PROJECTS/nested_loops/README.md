🚀 Nested Loops Showcase Project

Author: Waqar Ali
Purpose: Demonstrate real-world and interview-style nested loop problems in Python with dynamic, interactive examples.

🌟 Project Overview

This Python project is designed to teach and showcase nested loops in an engaging, hands-on way. Each section of the project highlights practical applications of nested loops in real-world scenarios, programming exercises, and common interview questions.

The project is interactive and dynamic, allowing the user to input custom values for rows, seats, players, colors, categories, and more. This makes it flexible, reusable, and beginner-friendly while maintaining advanced examples for interview practice.

📂 Features
✅ Interactive Examples

Cinema Seat Layout
Print all seat numbers dynamically. Example: Rows: A, B, C | Seats per row: 5 → A1, A2…C5.

Outfit Combinations
Generate all possible shirt–pant combinations from user-defined lists.

Clock Minutes Display
Print every minute in a given range dynamically.

Timetable Generator
Display timetable for a configurable number of days and time slots.

Bus Seating Chart
Generate dynamic bus seat layouts based on rows and seat labels.

Tic-Tac-Toe Board
Print a dynamic Tic-Tac-Toe board of any size.

Star Pyramid Pattern
Display a star pyramid with a user-defined number of rows.

Team Pair Generator
Generate all possible team pairs from a custom list of players.

Multiplication Tables
Display full multiplication tables for a user-defined range.

Shopping Categories
Print shopping categories and their products dynamically.

✅ Interview Questions

Time complexity of nested loops?
Usually O(n²) but depends on loop sizes.

When to replace nested loops with list comprehensions?
When readability improves or concise data transformation is needed.

🎯 Dynamic Features

All examples are user-driven:

Choose rows, seats, players, colors, categories, or pyramid height.

Interactive menu allows selecting individual examples or run all at once.

Works as a learning tool for understanding nested loops, patterns, and combinatorics.
