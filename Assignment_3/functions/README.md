Author: Waqar Ali
Section: Functions + Loops
Purpose: Interactive Python utility hub for real-life tasks and interview prep

🚀 Project Overview

Welcome to Python Utility Hub — an all-in-one interactive toolkit designed to make learning Python fun, practical, and interview-ready!

This project is a command-line application that combines core Python concepts like functions, loops, strings, and data structures into real-world utilities. Every tool is carefully designed to be modular, reusable, and educational, helping you master Python fundamentals while solving problems you could encounter in everyday coding or interviews.

Think of it as your personal Python playground—learn by doing, explore multiple solutions, and see immediate results in the terminal.

🛠️ Features & Utilities

Python Utility Hub includes 12 interactive tools, each demonstrating a key Python concept:

#	Tool	Description
1	Count PDF files	Count .pdf files from a list of filenames.
2	Username Availability Checker	Case-insensitive check to see if a username is taken.
3	Longest Word Finder	Identify the longest word in a sentence.
4	Palindrome Checker	Determine if a string reads the same backward.
5	Multiplication Table Generator	Generate the table of any number (1–10).
6	Dice Roll Simulator	Simulate dice rolls until a 6 appears.
7	Product Filter by Price	Filter products under a user-defined price.
8	Password Masker	Replace passwords with asterisks for security.
9	Word Frequency Counter	Count occurrences of words in a sentence.
10	Hashtag Extractor	Extract hashtags from social media posts using regex.
11	Return vs Print Demo	Learn the difference between returning and printing values.
12	Multiple Return Values Demo	Functions returning multiple values (tuple/list/dictionary).
🎯 Learning Goals
